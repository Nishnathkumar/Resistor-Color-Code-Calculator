# Resistor Color Code Calculator

A simple web tool for decoding resistor color codes and calculating the corresponding resistance values. This application allows users to easily determine the resistance value based on color bands and vice versa.

## Features

- Decode resistor color codes to find the resistance value and tolerance.
- Calculate color bands based on the entered resistance value.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the application.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for handling color code decoding and resistance calculations.

## How to Use

1. **Decode Resistor Colors**:
   - Select the color bands from the dropdown menus.
   - Click **Decode** to display the resistance value and tolerance.

2. **Calculate Color Bands**:
   - Enter the resistance value and tolerance (if applicable).
   - Click **Calculate** to show the corresponding color bands.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that provides the structure and layout of the tool.
- `style.css`: The CSS file used for styling the application and enhancing its visual appeal.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for decoding color codes and calculating resistance values.
